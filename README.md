## Project Description

This project is a local Python version of OpusClip, a tool designed for video creators to repurpose longer videos into short, engaging content for social media platforms like YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram Reels. The tool offers a range of features including AI Clipping, AI B-Roll, animated captions, social media scheduling, team workspace and collaboration tools, virality score, export and integration options, customization and branding, and aspect ratio adjustments.

### Key Features

- **AI Clipping & AI B-Roll**: Analyzes long videos, identifies the most compelling segments, and automatically creates short clips. Adds contextually relevant AI B-roll to enhance visual appeal and storytelling.
- **Animated Captions & Overlays**: Provides automated animated captions with high accuracy. Users can customize overlays, fonts, and more.
- **Social Media Scheduler**: Allows users to schedule and autopost clips directly to social platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and LinkedIn.
- **Team Workspace & Collaboration Tools**: Enables creation of team workspaces for seamless collaboration, shared brand templates, and centralized asset libraries.
- **Virality Score & AI Curation**: Provides a "Virality Score" for each clip and helps curate the most attention-grabbing parts.
- **Export & Integration**: Exports videos to Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve as XML files. Offers API and custom integrations for business users.
- **Customization & Branding**: Allows creation of multiple brand templates with custom fonts, logos, and colors.
- **Aspect Ratio Adjustments**: Adjusts clips for different aspect ratios (9:16, 1:1, 16:9) to optimize for different platforms.
